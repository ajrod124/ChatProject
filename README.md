# Chat Project

A stipped down version of the discord mobile app with an added collaborative whiteboard functionality.

## Directions

Make sure that you have both a socket server and database server already set up. These could be found at https://github.com/ajrod124/socketServer and https://github.com/ajrod124/chatDbServer repectively, or you can write your own.

Then:

1. Clone repo
2. Navigate to /ChatProject
3. npm install
4. Edit the urls in "urls.js" to the urls of your deployed servers
5. react-native start
